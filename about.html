                <p>A highly motivated individual who is seeking a change of career after years in support. I am hardworking and always eager to learn new skills and advance my career further. As this is a change back to a previous interest, I am currently progressing through an online course (codecademy) and am currently working on an online portfolio to add both previous and new works to.</p>
                <p>My career has always involved assisting others and improving their skills/knowledge of the system at hand and I would like to continue this whilst adding to my own skill set. As a self-motivated person, I am keen to continue moving forward whilst challenging myself to improve.</p>
